## Description
it has 3 files which are:
## Question 1
It has a function swapCase which is designed to take an input string and swap the case of each character in the string. It does this by iterating over each character in the input string, checking if the character is uppercase, and then converting it to lowercase if it is, or converting it to uppercase if it's not. This effectively swaps the case of each character in the string.
## Question 2
It also has a function  called generateArrayBetween designed to generate an array of numbers between a given start and end point, inclusive. It works by determining the direction of the sequence (increasing or decreasing) based on the comparison of the start and end values. Then, it iterates from the start value to the end value, adding each number to the array.
## Question 3
Checks if a given number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
